                    <h2>Meat</h2>
                    <p>Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food. Humans have hunted, farmed, and scavenged animals for
                        meat since prehistoric times. The establishment of settlements in the Neolithic Revolution
                        allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs, and cattle. This
                        eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale in slaughterhouses.</p>

                    <h2>Salad</h2>
                    <p>A salad can be a composed salad (with the ingredients specifically arranged on the serving dish)
                        or a tossed salad (with the ingredients placed in a bowl and mixed, often with salad dressing).
                        An antipasto plate, the first dish of a formal Italian meal, is similar to a composed salad, and
                        has vegetables, cheese, and meat.</p>

                    <h2>Side</h2>
                    <p>Side dishes such as salad, potatoes and bread are commonly used with main courses throughout many
                        countries of the western world. Rice and couscous have grown to be quite popular throughout
                        Europe, especially at formal occasions (with couscous appearing more commonly at dinner parties
                        with Middle Eastern dishes).</p>

                    <h2>Dessert</h2>
                    <p>Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course consists of sweet foods, such as
                        confections, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine and liqueur. In some parts of the
                        world, such as much of Greece and West Africa, and most parts of China, there is no tradition of
                        a dessert course to conclude a meal.</p>
