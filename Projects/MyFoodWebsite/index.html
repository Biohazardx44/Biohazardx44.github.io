                    <h2>Meat</h2>
                    <p>Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food. Humans have hunted, farmed, and scavenged animals for
                        meat since prehistoric times. The establishment of settlements in the Neolithic Revolution
                        allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs, and cattle. This
                        eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale in slaughterhouses.</p>

                    <h2>Salad</h2>
                    <p>A salad can be a composed salad (with the ingredients specifically arranged on the serving dish)
                        or a tossed salad (with the ingredients placed in a bowl and mixed, often with salad dressing).
                        An antipasto plate, the first dish of a formal Italian meal, is similar to a composed salad, and
                        has vegetables, cheese, and meat.</p>

                    <h2>Dessert</h2>
                    <p>Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course consists of sweet foods, such as
                        confections, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine and liqueur. In some parts of the
                        world, such as much of Greece and West Africa, and most parts of China, there is no tradition of
                        a dessert course to conclude a meal.</p>
